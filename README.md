#pyDrinkinbot

##A graphical version of the infamous Drinkinbot!

Requires PySide and festival.

##TODO:
 - More balanced drinkers-choice
 - The settings Tab is superugly..
 - with --play-pause rhythmbox has to play before the bot starts.
    Bad?

Best voice yet: voice_cmu_us_jmk_arctic_clunits
But really.. default is fine
