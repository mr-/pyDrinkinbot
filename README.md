#pyDrinkinbot

##A graphical version of the infamous Drinkinbot!
(To start it, go to src and run "python pyDrinkinbot.py")

By popular demand! 

It's back! 

Now with **Graphical** User Interface! 

And many more Cool Features(TM)!

But look for yourself..

![The Bot!](/screens/bot.png "The Bot!")


##Requirements
Python, PySide and festival.

Optionally something to pause music from commandline. (e.g. rhythmbox-client)

##TODO:
 - Better drinkers-chooser. completely random is uncool.
    Don't know how good the current one is..
 - with --play-pause rhythmbox has to play before the bot starts.
    Bad?
 - The settings Tab is superugly:

##Notes:
Best voice yet: voice_cmu_us_jmk_arctic_clunits
But really.. default is fine
